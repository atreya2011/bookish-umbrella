  # There has been an intermittent issue with this task where it would fail and print the error:
  # 
  #     Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), is another process
  #     using it?
  #
  # The reason for this is unclear. It's not from unattended-upgrades as that has already been
  # uninstalled when creating the base image. The workaround for now is to simply retry this task
  # several times in the event that it fails, with a small delay between each attempt.
  register: result
  until: result is not failed
